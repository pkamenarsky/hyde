When it comes to developing software it is important to chose the proverbial right tool for the job. We are well versed in mainstream languages, like C / C++, Java, PHP or Ruby and have worked on both small and large codebases using those. That said, if we are let to decide, we prefer functional languages - specifically Clojure, Erlang and Haskell, depending on the project domain. We believe that those platforms allow for a more composable, robust and testable way of building software, resulting in fewer bugs and both smaller development and maintenance costs.

Erlang is a dynamic industrial language specifically aimed at efficient development of competitive high availability systems. Its features make it possible to upgrade live systems without interruption, ensuring minimum downtime; it allows for transparent scalability and distribution and its sophisticated supervision and error handling facilities make it the obvious choice for building fault tolerant, reliable services.

Haskell is a mind bending, statically typed purely-functional language; it has a diverse range of use commercially, from aerospace and defense, to finance and hardware design firms. An open-source product of more than twenty years of cutting-edge research, it allows rapid development of robust, concise and correct software.

Clojure is a functional dynamic programming language that targets the Java Virtual Machine; as a dialect of Lisp it shares its code-as-data philosophy and powerful macro system. It specifically shines in areas of symbolic data manipulation with a flexible or no model structure, logic programming and concurrent designs, due to its elegant software transactional memory implementation.
