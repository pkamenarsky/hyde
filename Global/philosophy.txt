It pays to do things right the first time; unnecessary changes are ex&shy;pensive. It has been shown that a change in the early stages of a project, in requirements or architecture, costs 50 to 200 times less than the same change later, in construction or maintenance. This is common sense, but we have far too often seen projects slip through deadlines because of this, resulting in unstable releases, feature cuts, unfulfilled promises and angry customers.

The first step we do before anything else is sit with the client and define a clear statement of the problem that the system is supposed to solve. We then go on to carefully formalize the requirement specifications to a degree that is best suited to the size, complexity and criticality of the designed platform.

There are many methodologies for managing software development, but some are better suited to a specific project domain than others. For example, a critical backend service may require rigid and precise specifications and a stricter process of proposing and accepting changes compared to a more casual user facing application. On the other hand, the latter may benefit from a more iterative prototyping cycle, allowing for faster and easier modifications depending on user tests and client feedback.

This is why we always try to strike the perfect balance between too little and too much formality.

We then go on to develop what has been agreed upon. [?]
